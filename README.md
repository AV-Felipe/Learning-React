# Carl Rippon - ASP.NET Core 5 and React

## Frontend Using React

### Self-Learning Project

This project was developed following the example in the second edition of the book "ASP.NET Core 5 and React" by Carl Rippon.

The main purpose here is for me to learn and acquire some practice in developing a frontend project with React.

There are some coding best practices that are not being observed, such as sorting the component files in a component folder and some over commented code passages, but, again, the focus here is learning React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (here using TypeScript).
